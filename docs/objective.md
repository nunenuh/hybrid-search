# Account Name Mapping Solution

## Objective
Implement a solution to map various account names from multiple columns to a preferred account name. The primary goal is to ensure accurate and efficient mapping using a combination of traditional and advanced search techniques.

## Problem Statement

### Initial Mapping
1. **Create a Dictionary Table:** Store the mapping between account names from multiple columns (e.g., Column F and G) to the preferred account names listed in Column C.
2. **Implement Keyword Search:** Retrieve account names based on this mapping.

### Handling Unmapped Account Names
1. **Develop a Solution for Unmapped Names:** Handle account names that do not exist in the current mapping table with a more sophisticated approach to ensure accurate mapping.

### Hybrid Search Implementation
1. **Implement a Hybrid Search Mechanism:** Combine keyword search and similarity search for better accuracy.
2. **Utilize Advanced Algorithms and Tools:** Use algorithms like BM25 and libraries such as HuggingFace to achieve this.

## Deliverables

### Code Implementation
1. **Script/Notebook:** Demonstrate the initial mapping using a dictionary table and traditional search.
2. **Extend the Script:** Include a hybrid search mechanism for handling unmapped account names.
3. **Documentation:** Ensure the code is well-documented and includes explanations of key steps and decisions.

### Explanation and Justification
1. **Written Explanation:** Highlight how the hybrid search mechanism works.
2. **Justification:** Explain the use of specific algorithms and tools, and describe how they contribute to the accuracy of the mapping.

### Sample Data
1. **Usage:** Use the provided sample data to demonstrate your solution (Columns F and G for dictionary table mapping, Columns H, I onwards for hybrid search).
2. **Adaptability:** Ensure the solution can handle the provided data and can be easily adapted to new data sets.

## Submission Guidelines
1. **Submission:** Submit your code, explanations, and any other relevant files in a compressed folder.
2. **Instructions:** Include clear instructions on how to run the code and replicate your results.
3. **Insights:** Provide any additional insights or recommendations for improving the mapping process.

## Evaluation Criteria
1. **Accuracy and Efficiency:** Evaluate the accuracy and efficiency of the mapping solution.
2. **Implementation:** Assess the proper implementation and integration of hybrid search techniques.
3. **Documentation:** Check the clarity and completeness of the documentation and explanations.
4. **Handling Unmapped Names:** Ensure the solution effectively handles unmapped account names.
